# KNN-ALGORITHM-IN-ML
The KNN algorithm is one of the most famous algorithms in machine learning and data mining. It does not preprocess the data before classification, which leads to longer time and more errors. To solve the problems, this paper first proposes a PK-means++ algorithm, which can better ensure the stability of a random experiment. Then, based on it and spherical region division, an improved KNNPK+ is proposed. The algorithm can select the center of the spherical region appropriately and then construct an initial classifier for the training set to improve the accuracy and time of classification
